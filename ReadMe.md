Step-1 : Run the code in notebook dataprocessing.ipynb to get the filtered dataset.
Step-2 : Run the "Gender_Model_RMSprop.py" to get the gender model and Run the "agemodel_CNN2.py" to get the age model.
Step-3 : Please make sure you change your runtime to GPU. The above scripts were run in MobaXterm connected to GPU server that is available.
Step-4 : Now that we have completed our models, use those saved models in "AgeGender_Testing.ipynb" to get the output(Gender & Age) displayed on either image input, Recorded video input, Live video recording.
